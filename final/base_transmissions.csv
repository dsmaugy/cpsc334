Its very nature is to move at the speed of light, and it will move more quickly than a chunk of earth no matter how we build it, or what we compare it to. And while the speed of the current net often appears to adversely affect our sense of time and our anxieties, it is difficult to say where that settles over the millennia.

TX3676,1464,3457,2,14,1460,"Siamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins is phenomenal from start to finish but man is it hard for me to listen to now that I'm 40. I don't know if it's the fact that I listened to it religiously as a suicidally depressed teen in the mid 90s or if it's because of how masterfully these guys can compose a song that is simultaneously somber, bittersweet but energetic at the same time.  So many emotions jammed into a catchy heavy rock song.  I could go on forever about this and Pisces Iscariot as well"
TX7167,2874,578,5,21,3185,"I’ve got a lot of people that care about me. And uh, it’s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now."
TX2325,956,696,2,6,3159,"I went on a walk with my friend who I haven’t seen since the beginning of the semester. We were going up Science Hill and came back down near Trumbull and Temple, around that intersection, around Hillhouse and Trumbull. There’s a backward kind of place that we had access to, that was on a hill. Sat there during the nighttime, looked at the waxing crescent moon. Really beautiful and I really felt connected and love for this friend and being able to sit with my boots and my pants on the grass on this hill and kind of just feel like these trees are huge and canopies around us and also the moon. Really beautiful moment and really nice to spend that half hour over there."
TX6353,2527,1024,0,23,599,"A phrase that comes to mind regularly for me is “The slow blade penetrates the shield,” a phrase from the novel Dune, spoken to the novel’s protagonist during a combat training session. I think of it because I like the notion that in the struggle to create something—to bring to fruition a project, a work of art, a company, whatever— sometimes the best strategy is slowness."
TX8411,2400,3079,2,15,3044,"I was thinking about all the important “nodal points'' (I don’t know what else to call this) of people, places, books, albums, websites, etc. that all played a part in shaping who I am as a person and what I think is important. These points are a combination of seeking things out myself and getting a recommendation that felt like it was actually for me. A mixture of both passive and active knowledge acquisition. This got me thinking that, ultimately, it's the totality of those “nodal points” that indicate one’s own unique perspective. It doesn’t matter if you specifically sought out the nodal point or not, it’s the recognition that counts."
TX5067,1482,2561,3,22,2581,"Oh maaaan, you dont know how much club penguin meant to my childhood, i still remember how this game allowed me to learn ANOTHER LANGUAGE, im from chile, latin america, i did not know a single word of english, until one day in a new years eve, the club penguin team that translated the game did not (i dont know if purposelly or not) translate the words on the title of the event ""coins for change"", and that made me want to investigate what it could mean, so i started translating word for word whatever i saw in club penguin, nightclub, pizza, whatever word id see plastered around the map, i would go and translate, that allowed me to start learning, and i know my english has yet a lot of improvement to do, but this has allowed me to meet thousands of wonderful people, is a talent that has allowed me to grow and also impress people, you dont know how much easier school became for me thanks to your artwork of a penguin and what it brought to my life. Also one of my most well regarded childhood memory is to me that once my grandma, a 64 year old woman back then who didnt knew nothing about club penguin, internet or anything at all, and that we didnt also had that much money, and here in chile we didnt also had much stuff arriving, i saw the first official product of the game like when i was 15 years old and i had started playing when i was 6 or 7, anyways, my grandma would always hear that i talked about penguins and stuff, and one day she was working on a market sale (like a latin market, a full street full of normal people with products from their farms, selling vegetables, fruits, used clothes, and whatever), she was a salesman for a communications brand (TV, internet, phone and that) and stopped to get a rest from delivering her number on paper to get new deals, and saw a pack of penguin cards that she found beautiful for me cause she knew i loved penguins, turns out it was an official pack of cards of the game, it had the codes and card jitsu cards, i was so amazed cause me and my mom, had looked on a retail stores, club penguin was nowhere to be found and somehow my grandma had it found on accident, i was given a cool guitar, clothes and stuff thanks to the code, i know its dumb but i remember being so happy and i couldnt believe my grandma had brought that to me out of nowhere.

TX3777,3006,2487,2,28,974,"I'm really grateful for the fact that I had access to computers at such an early age and that my parents encouraged me to tinker/play around with it. So much of my curiosity and excitement about learning and trying new things stems from Kindergarten me fucking around on the computer and doing random shit. I remember getting really invested in the iOS jailbreaking scene in 5th grade, looking up countless tutorials to jailbreak my iPod touch and browsing endless forum posts trying to troubleshoot any bootloops or soft bricks that eventually came up. It makes sense that I'm studying computer science now, but it's also a bit scary. So much of my life has been defined by computers, technology, the internet, and cyberspace in general. Without it, I'm not really sure who I would be. 

But again though, I guess everyone has something in their life that forms a core part of their identity. It could be people, passions, places, hobbies, etc. For me, I guess it's just computers."
