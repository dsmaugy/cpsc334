Images of ramps, boxing gloves, bowling balls, nitro glycerin. Then it all came back listening to the rest of the songs. An amazing soundtrack for an equally great game."

TX3529,3675,1606,5,2245,2172,"I was around 13 when I played this Half Life for the first time (21 yrs ago) and because I was allowed 30mins a day to play it took me 3 months to complete.  When someone asks me of my all time favourite games , this is on the tribune with THPS2 and skyrim. ❤"
TX2786,895,999,4,846,1190,"So the thing I keep thinking about is, was it worth it to be happy for a little bit, even though it ended up sad? Or would it be better if the whole thing would have never happened?"

TX2995,804,2429,6,1040,2361,"Siamese Dream by the Smashing Pumpkins is phenomenal from start to finish but man is it hard for me to listen to now that I'm 40. I don't know if it's the fact that I listened to it religiously as a suicidally depressed teen in the mid 90s or if it's because of how masterfully these guys can compose a song that is simultaneously somber, bittersweet but energetic at the same time.  So many emotions jammed into a catchy heavy rock song.  I could go on forever about this and Pisces Iscariot as well"
TX5685,2618,3254,2,3316,1395,"I’ve got a lot of people that care about me. And uh, it’s going to disappoint them to hear that I did this. I would like to apologize to each and every one of them. Um, just a broken guy, got a few screws loose, I guess. Never really knew it until now. Um, just, you know. …"
TX9472,2279,3158,1,1338,1455,"I went on a walk with my friend who I haven’t seen since the beginning of the semester. We were going up Science Hill and came back down near Trumbull and Temple, around that intersection, around Hillhouse and Trumbull. There’s a backward kind of place that we had access to, that was on a hill. Sat there during the nighttime, looked at the waxing crescent moon. Really beautiful and I really felt connected and love for this friend and being able to sit with my boots and my pants on the grass on this hill and kind of just feel like these trees are huge and canopies around us and also the moon. Really beautiful moment and really nice to spend that half hour over there."
TX8750,1385,2436,0,2845,2172,"A phrase that comes to mind regularly for me is “The slow blade penetrates the shield,” a phrase from the novel Dune, spoken to the novel’s protagonist during a combat training session. I think of it because I like the notion that in the struggle to create something—to bring to fruition a project, a work of art, a company, whatever— sometimes the best strategy is slowness."
TX9078,1881,1160,7,3893,2948,"I was thinking about all the other important “nodal points'' (I don’t know what else to call this) of people, places, books, albums, websites, etc. that all played a part in shaping who I am as a person and what I think is important. These points are a combination of seeking things out myself and getting a recommendation that felt like it was actually for me. A mixture of both passive and active knowledge acquisition. This got me thinking that, ultimately, it's the totality of those “nodal points” that indicate one’s own unique perspective. It doesn’t matter if you specifically sought out the nodal point or not, it’s the recognition that counts."
